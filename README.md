# Multithreaded Chat Server
A multithreaded ChatServer based on console which uses C Socket programming. Clients can connect across the network or even from the same machine using an IP address and port number. After connecting to the server, the client gets to choose his/her username and whenever it sends a message, the server broadcasts the message with the name of that client.
